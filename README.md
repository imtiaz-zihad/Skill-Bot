This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

To add Sign in with Google using Clerk authentication, follow these steps:

Step 1: Set Up Google OAuth Credentials
Go to the Google Cloud Console.

Select a project (or create a new one).

Navigate to APIs & Services > Credentials.

Click Create Credentials > OAuth Client ID.

Under Application Type, choose Web Application.

Set the Authorized Redirect URI to:

arduino
Copy
Edit
https://<your-clerk-instance>.clerk.accounts.dev/oauth_callback
(Replace <your-clerk-instance> with your actual Clerk instance URL.)

Click Create and save the Client ID and Client Secret.

Step 2: Configure Clerk for Google Authentication
Go to the Clerk Dashboard.

Select your application.

Navigate to Authentication > Social Connections.

Enable Google and paste the Client ID and Client Secret from Google Cloud Console.

Save the settings.

Step 3: Add Google Sign-in to Your React App
If you're using Clerk with React, install Clerk SDK:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install @clerk/clerk-react
Then, wrap your app with Clerk Provider in index.js or App.js:

jsx
Copy
Edit
import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/clerk-react';

const clerkPubKey = "your-clerk-public-key";

function App() {
  return (
    <ClerkProvider publishableKey={clerkPubKey}>
      {/* Your Routes and Components */}
    </ClerkProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
To add a Google Sign-in button, use:

jsx
Copy
Edit
import { SignIn } from '@clerk/clerk-react';

export default function SignInPage() {
  return <SignIn path="/sign-in" />;
}
OR use a direct button for Google sign-in:

jsx
Copy
Edit
import { useSignIn } from "@clerk/clerk-react";

export default function GoogleSignInButton() {
  const { signIn } = useSignIn();

  return (
    <button onClick={() => signIn.authenticateWithRedirect({ strategy: "oauth_google" })}>
      Sign in with Google
    </button>
  );
}
Step 4: Test Google Sign-in
Start your development server:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm start
Open the sign-in page and test the Sign in with Google option.

To find your Clerk Instance URL, follow these steps:

Step 1: Go to Clerk Dashboard
Log in to Clerk Dashboard.

Select your application.

Step 2: Locate Your Clerk Instance
Click on Developers (left sidebar).

You will find your Instance API keys and settings.

Your Clerk instance URL is usually in this format:

cpp
Copy
Edit
https://<your-clerk-instance>.clerk.accounts.dev
Step 3: Get the OAuth Callback URL
Your OAuth callback URL should be:

arduino
Copy
Edit
https://<your-clerk-instance>.clerk.accounts.dev/oauth_callback
Copy this URL and paste it in your Google Cloud Console under: APIs & Services > Credentials > OAuth Client ID > Authorized Redirect URIs.

Alternative Way: Use the Provided OAuth URL
In Clerk Dashboard, go to Authentication > Social Connections.

Enable Google OAuth.

Clerk might auto-generate the OAuth callback URL for you.
